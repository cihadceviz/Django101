# Django101 Project

## Purpose of the Project
Django101 is a personal project initiated to learn the Django web framework. This project aims to explore and apply the fundamental concepts of Django and its use in web development throughout my individual learning journey.

## Contents
In this project, I am working on Django's model-view-template architecture, database operations, URL routing, form processing, and other essential features of Django. Each topic is addressed in detail to track my progress in learning and to gain practical experience.

## Personal Goals
This project is entirely a personal learning journey aimed at enhancing my basic knowledge of web development with Django. I intend to improve my understanding of Django's fundamental structure and practical skills in web development by progressing at my own pace and according to my learning needs.

## Structure of the Project
The project contains example applications and code snippets where the learned topics are applied. Each module focuses on the practical implementation of the theoretical knowledge acquired. Additionally, the challenges I encounter, the solutions I find, and my learning notes are also part of the project.
